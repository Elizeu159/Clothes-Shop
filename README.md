This project consists of a clothes shop, developed in under 48 hours. You will be able to move the character and interact with the Shopkeeper to open the Shop.

Inside the shop you can sell unequipped clothes and try out every one of them before buying. Leaving the shop will return the character to their equipped outfits.

Outside the shop you can access your Clothes Inventory, there you are able to equip outfits you have bought in the store.

All the sprites and animations come from free packages from the Asset Store.
